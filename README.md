# Content Management System

This application was designed to perform as a Content Management System for a company's management team to keep an up-to-date record of their staff. 

In the form of a CLI, node, inquirer and MYSQL were implemented to allow a user to view, update, or delete departments, roles, and employees within their company.

Upon running, the CLI guides it's user through a series of steps to manage their staff. After a selected task is completed, the application runs again to allow as many changes and/or views as needed to appropriately update the company database.
